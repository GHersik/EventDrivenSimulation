# Event Driven Simulation

At the bottom of the application there are two buttons and one drop down list in the middle.
The first button on the left either stops or starts the time, in the middle drop down list section specifies which simulation should be generated next, the second button on the far right generates the simulation. You can also right or left click with your mouse on any particle at any moment to track it's position and it's velocity vector as well as the distance between the two marked by a green line.

The code was written by studying through the https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/61event/ and so it does contain small amount of source code translated from Java to C#, the parts are marked within the source code.
